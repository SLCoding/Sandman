### Work In Progress Disclaimer

This project is not ready yet! In fact we just rebooted this project. And this time we do it right! Right?
If you want to use it, do yourself a favor and wait until it's ready. At this moment you won't have much fun with this early dev version. ;-)


# Sandman

Sandman puts your server to sleep when it's not in use.
It's aimed towards home/media servers, but in theory you could use it for every linux box you don't want to run 24/7.
This (hopefully) results in lower energy costs and extended hardware life.

## Description

There are a bunch of pre made Plugins you can use to check different conditions
- Are local or ssh users logged in?
- Are computers in the network up?
- Are processes running which shouldn't be interrupted?
- ... or whatever you want Sandman to check. Check out our [PluginInterface](sandman/api/).
